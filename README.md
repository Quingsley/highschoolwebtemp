# Project Problem

Assume you have been contracted to create a website for a local Secondary School (your former 
high school is suggested). Build and create a simple website of at least 10 web pages. Pages should 
include text, images, hyperlinks (there should be a navigation menu on each page). Demonstrate the 
use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Suggested pages include
      • Home page
      • School administration – On this page you show the school leadership. 
      • A page for each department including photos and a message from the Head of 
         department. 
      • Pages each for some of the co-curricular activities at the school like sports, music 
         and clubs. 
      • A registration page for alumni to register through an appropriate form. 
Embed appropriate multimedia (videos and audios) in some of the pages. 
Make use of HTML tables where necessary.
Maintain a common theme and consistent look and feel for your website (keep with the school 
colors). 
You may use place holder images/resources from the internet if necessary
